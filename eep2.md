| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meaning    | How well a product meets customer needs and expectations at the time of purchase. | Ability of the product to perform its function consistently over time. |
| Focus      | Performance, features, appearance.                                                | Durability, dependability, and long-term function.                     |
| Example    | A smartphone with a sharp display and good design = high quality.                 | The same smartphone working smoothly for 5+ years = high reliability.  |

üëâ In short: **Quality = good at first use**, **Reliability = good for a long time**.

### 6. Define MTTF and give one example.

**Answer:**

* **MTTF (Mean Time To Failure):** The average time a non-repairable system or product works before it fails.
* It measures the **expected lifetime** of a product.
* **Example:** If 100 light bulbs fail after an average of 1,000 hours, then MTTF = 1,000 hours.

---

### 7. Define MTBF and give one example.

**Answer:**

* **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** The average time between two failures of a repairable system.
* It measures **reliability and uptime**.
* **Example:** A machine operates for 200 hours, then fails, gets repaired, and again runs for 220 hours before next failure. Average (200 + 220)/2 = 210 hours ‚Üí MTBF = 210 hours.

### 16. A bakery baked 12,000 loaves of bread using 15 workers, each working 6 hours/day for 30 days. What are the values of production and productivity during this period?

**Given:**

* Total production = 12,000 loaves
* Workers = 15
* Hours/day = 6
* Days = 30

**Step 1: Calculate total labour hours**

$$
\text{Total hours} = 15 \times 6 \times 30 = 2700 \, \text{hours}
$$

**Step 2: Productivity formula**

$$
\text{Productivity} = \frac{\text{Output (loaves)}}{\text{Input (labour hours)}}
$$

$$
\text{Productivity} = \frac{12,000}{2700} \approx 4.44 \, \text{loaves/hour}
$$

‚úÖ **Answer:**

* Production = **12,000 loaves**
* Productivity = **4.44 loaves per labour-hour**

### 17. A mobile phone assembly unit produced 25,000 phones using 40 workers, each working 8 hours/day for 25 days. What are the values of production and productivity during this period?

**Given:**

* Total production = 25,000 phones
* Workers = 40
* Hours/day = 8
* Days = 25

**Step 1: Calculate total labour hours**

$$
\text{Total hours} = 40 \times 8 \times 25 = 8000 \, \text{hours}
$$

**Step 2: Productivity**

$$
\text{Productivity} = \frac{25,000}{8000} = 3.125 \, \text{phones/hour}
$$

### 21. ‚ÄúComplexity increases uncertainty, uncertainty creates risk, and ambiguity makes communication difficult.‚Äù Explain this statement with engineering examples.

**Answer:**

* **Complexity increases uncertainty** ‚Üí When a system has many interdependent parts, predicting outcomes becomes harder.

  * *Example:* Designing a smart city involves electricity, water, and transport systems ‚Üí more complex ‚Üí harder to predict failures.

* **Uncertainty creates risk** ‚Üí Since outcomes are unpredictable, there is a chance of accidents or losses.

  * *Example:* New metro project may face uncertain passenger demand ‚Üí financial risk.

* **Ambiguity makes communication difficult** ‚Üí When goals or requirements are not clearly defined, misunderstanding occurs.

  * *Example:* If government instructions for a bridge design are unclear, engineers may design it differently than expected.

üëâ In short: **Complexity ‚Üí Uncertainty ‚Üí Risk ‚Üí Ambiguity** makes engineering projects harder to manage.
