### 2. Define engineering as a profession.

**Answer:**

* Engineering as a profession means **using the knowledge of engineering in real life** to serve society.
* A profession requires **proper training, education, ethics, and responsibility**.
* Engineers apply their knowledge to create things that are **useful, safe, and beneficial** for people.
* Example: A civil engineer designs a safe bridge â†’ this is professional work.

### 3. Differentiate between engineering as a discipline and engineering as a profession.

| **Point** | **Discipline**                                   | **Profession**                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Meaning   | Study of engineering concepts in books and labs. | Practical use of engineering knowledge in real life. |
| Focus     | Learning, research, and developing knowledge.    | Service, responsibility, and applying knowledge.     |
| Example   | Studying computer programming in college.        | Working as a software engineer in a company.         |

ðŸ‘‰ In short: **Discipline = Learning**, **Profession = Doing**.

### 6. What is meant by â€˜problem-solvingâ€™ in the context of engineering?

**Answer:**

* Problem-solving in engineering means **finding practical and effective solutions** to technical or real-world problems using **science, mathematics, and creativity**.
* It involves steps like **understanding the problem â†’ analyzing â†’ designing solutions â†’ testing â†’ improving**.
* Example:

  * Civil engineer solving traffic jams by designing flyovers.
  * Software engineer fixing security issues in an app.

---

### 7. Mention two examples of engineers who have brought significant societal change.

**Answer:**

1. **M. Visvesvaraya (India)** â†’ Designed dams and irrigation systems, helped in flood control and water supply.
2. **Nikola Tesla** â†’ Worked on electricity and alternating current (AC system), which powers modern homes and industries.

ðŸ‘‰ These engineers improved **societyâ€™s lifestyle and development**.

---

### 8. What is meant by the design function of an engineer?

**Answer:**

* The design function means **planning and creating new products, structures, or systems** that are useful, safe, and efficient.
* It includes **drawing plans, selecting materials, testing, and improving designs**.
* Example: Designing a bridge, mobile phone, or eco-friendly building.
  ðŸ‘‰ In short: **Design = turning ideas into practical reality**.

---

### 9. State two key roles of a professional engineer in project management.

**Answer:**

1. **Planning and organizing** â†’ Setting project goals, deciding steps, and managing resources (time, money, manpower).
2. **Monitoring and controlling** â†’ Checking progress, ensuring safety, quality, and completing work within deadlines.

ðŸ‘‰ These roles ensure a project is **successful, safe, and cost-effective**.

### 10. Discuss how interdisciplinary knowledge enhances an engineer's ability to act as a change agent in todayâ€™s technological world.

**Answer:**

* Interdisciplinary knowledge means **combining skills from different fields** (like computer science + electronics + biology).
* Todayâ€™s problems are complex, so an engineer must know **multiple areas** to solve them.
* Example:

  * A biomedical engineer (biology + electronics) develops artificial organs.
  * A computer + mechanical engineer builds smart robots.
* With such knowledge, engineers become **change agents** by creating **innovative, advanced, and sustainable solutions** for society.
